# Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Read the CSV file and parse it into a two-dimensional array.

2. Iterate through each cell in the table and check if it contains a formula. If a cell contains a formula,
   extract the formula string and use a separate method to parse and evaluate the formula.
   If the cell contains a value, leave it as is.

3. For each formula, parse the string to extract the cell references and the operators used in the formula. 
   Use these references to look up the values of the referenced cells in the table.

4. Evaluate the formula using the values of the referenced cells and the operators in the formula.

5. Replace the formula in the table with its calculated value.

6. Write the updated table to a new CSV file.

=> To handle errors, we can check for the following:

1. Invalid CSV format: The CSV file may not have the correct number of columns or rows, or may contain invalid 
   characters. We can use a try-catch block to handle exceptions thrown by the CSV parsing library.

2. Invalid formula: The formula in a cell may contain syntax errors or reference cells that do not exist.
   We can use regular expressions to validate the formula syntax and check that the referenced cells exist in 
   the table.

3. Division by zero: A formula may contain a division operation with zero as the denominator, which would
   result in an error. We can check for this case and handle it appropriately.

-> To prevent users from breaking the code, we can validate the CSV file before processing it, and provide
   clear error messages if there are any issues. We can also restrict the types of formulas that can be used
   in the cells, and handle any errors gracefully by providing informative error messages to the user.
